# FlashCards 


## Abstract

Flashcards is a question and answer game fully playable on the command line. One goal of this project was to practice utilizing larger datasets using class to class interaction. Another goal was to practice building unit tests in tandem with implementation code using the Mocha framework and Chai test library.

## Install/Setup instructions

To play Flashcards and study facts about iterator methods:

- `cd` into the directory
- Run `npm install` on the command line
- Run `node index.js` to start the game


## Wins & Challenges

A challenge of Flashcards was to think ahead of implementation to be able to write effective and useful tests. It was a really great exercise for zooming out my mindset to think big picture and slowing down the development process.
